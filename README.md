# My ideas

These are my (technical) ideas in the process of thinking.
Incomplete, contradictory, incorrect, worthless, etc. Some may have merit.

Yes, out in the open. No, I am not afraid of someone stealing them.

Actually, go ahead, steal an idea from here and implement it. I will only be
glad: one more good idea implemented, and I don't need to bother to do it myself :)
